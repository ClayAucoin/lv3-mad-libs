# Mad Libs Mini-Project

## Goal

Our goal was to create a web application by setting up and using an Express.js server with form handling to serve static HTML files able that can handle query strings on the backend.

## Notes

-   I noticed is I was getting errors from the css tags in my html getting a error saying that they were "blocked due to MIME type (“text/html”) mismatch (X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff)".
